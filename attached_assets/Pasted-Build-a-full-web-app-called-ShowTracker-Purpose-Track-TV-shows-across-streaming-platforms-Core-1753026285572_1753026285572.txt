Build a full web app called ShowTracker.  

Purpose: Track TV shows across streaming platforms

Core features:  
1. **Single dashboard page** with 3 tabs:  
   - Currently Watching  
   - Plan to Watch  
   - Completed (with a filter to view All Time, Last 30 Days, Last 3 Months, or This Year)  
   Tabs must switch instantly with no lag and show an underline or highlight for the active tab.  

2. **Show tiles** must display only:  
   - Show title (centered)  
   - Streaming platform name badge (top right overlay, using official brand color for Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc.)  
   - Poster/thumbnail image (you must always have an image of the show, you can grab this from Google images)
   - One action button per tile:  
     - "Mark Completed" (green) in Currently Watching.  
     - "Move to Watching" (blue) in Plan to Watch.  
     - "Rewatch" (orange) in Completed (moves show back to Currently Watching).  

3. **Image fetching (must not break):**  
   - Step 1: Search Google for the most accurate poster or scene image of the show.  
   - Step 2 (fallback): Use my TMDB API key to fetch the official thumbnail.  
   - Must never leave a broken or missing image.  

4. **Add Show button and form:**  
   - Button is on the far right of the "Your Dashboard" header row.  
   - Clicking opens a dialog with only 3 fields: title, platform, status (default status = Plan to Watch).  
   - On submit, automatically fetches the image and creates the tile in the correct tab.  

5. **Authentication:**  
   - Simple username-based login.  
   - No password.  
   - If you know the username, you can log into that account.  
   - Each account stores its own show data separately.  

6. **UI:**  
   - Clean, modern, minimal design.  
   - Tab headers (Currently Watching, Plan to Watch, Completed) appear at the top of each view.  
   - Smooth, instant tab transitions with visual feedback.  
8. **Scope:**  
   - No discovery, search, or episode/season tracking.  
   - Only the dashboard, add show flow, login, and functional tabs.  

Deliver a fully functional app with all features above. All bugs in add show and image fetching must be fixed. UI must be polished and responsive.
